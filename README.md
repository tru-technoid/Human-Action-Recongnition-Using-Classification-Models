# Human Action Recognition Using Classification Models

This project focuses on the recognition and classification of human actions using various machine learning models. The repository includes preprocessing steps, model implementations, and a detailed comparison of performance across different architectures.

The Colab notebook outlines a Human Action Classification, focusing on identifying and analyzing human actions using multiple classification models. 

## Key sections and models include :

-**Preprocessing** : Data preparation and augmentation steps.
-**Custom Model** : A tailored model for action recognition.
-**VGG16 Model** : Transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture.
-**CNN Model** : Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network.
-**ResNet50 Model** : Using the ResNet50 architecture for feature extraction.
-**DenseNet Model** : Leveraging DenseNet for action classification.
-**Comparative Analysis** : Evaluation and comparison of all models.
