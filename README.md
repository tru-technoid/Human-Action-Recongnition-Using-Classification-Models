# Human Action Recognition Using Classification Models

This project focuses on the recognition and classification of human actions using various machine learning models. The repository includes preprocessing steps, model implementations, and a detailed comparison of performance across different architectures.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes normalization and augmentation techniques.
- **Model Implementations**:
  - Custom Model
  - VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
  - CNN
  - ResNet50
  - DenseNet
- **Comparative Analysis**: Performance evaluation of all models.
  
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib, NumPy, and other essential libraries.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Human-Action-Recognition.git
   ```
